This is my Final Year Project I completed at the University of Surrey.

In order to access this project you must have a Linux (Ubuntu) Operating System.

Once you download the project, remember to extract the files.

Once the file has been extracted, go onto the Ubuntu Terminal and type "cd Quotes"

Once you are in the file on the Terminal, you can access the project by typing in "Rails S" which will open the rails server.

Go onto any web brower and type in "localhost:3000"

Enjoy!!
